Every day, the working man toils,
Sweat and time soaked into the soil.
Earning his keep, in paper and metal,
But the value diminishes, with every press of the pedal.

The price of milk, the cost of bread,
Silently rising, fostering dread.
Yet many attribute it to times getting tough,
Unaware it's the system, playing rough.

Invisible chains bind the publics trust,
As their hard earned wealth turns to dust.
Blinded by routine, in this subtle deceit,
Not noticing the robbery, however discreet.

Hours become paper, paper turns to coin,
But what does it mean, when it starts to join?
The creeping doubt, the value's loss,
Hard work traded for something that's dross.

Work of the many, strength of the masses,
Exchanged for the hollow, as time passes.
Invisible shackles, the system's discourse,
Hard work rewarded with something worthless, of course.

Stripped of value, the hours we give,
In this financial game, it's hard to live.
Central banking, a system flawed,
A silent heist, where the many are robbed.
