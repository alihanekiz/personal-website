The climate cry rings loud and clear,\
From those in high towers, who seem to steer.\
They preach to the many about the Earth's dire state,\
Yet in their own lives, their actions don't equate.

Private jets for the affluent, while the masses ride bikes,\
Irony hidden in the climate strikes.\
Rules for thee, but not for me,\
A truth, though veiled, for those who see.

The rich and powerful declare a crisis,\
Yet their carbon footprints reveal the vices.\
In their wake, a trail of emission,\
Against their own words, a stark admission.

Luxury yachts and expansive estates,\
While the common man reduces and waits.\
A tale of two worlds, in the climate fight,\
One in the shadows, one in the light.

In the streets, the citizens lie,\
Their bodies a barrier against cars passing by.\
Glued to the asphalt, in fervent devotion,\
A display of their unwavering emotion.

In their zeal, they impede the very same,\
Brainwashed in a climate game.\
Unaware of the contradiction in their stand,\
As they stick to the roads, throughout the land.

Believing they're saving the world from harm,\
Yet in reality, causing more alarm.\
A dance of irony, under the sun's glaring light,\
In the complex saga of the climate fight.
