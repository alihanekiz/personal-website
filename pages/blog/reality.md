Nothing is as it seems. 

The majority of people are so deeply ensnared in the routines of daily life that they can no longer perceive the true qualities and values of real life. We live in an era where a month passes like a week, a week like a day, a day like an hour, an hour like a minute, and a minute like a second. 

It is more important than ever to live in the present and savor the moment. 

Once one is trapped in this reality, it becomes exceedingly difficult to escape. This is followed by a series of lies that most people have accepted as truth, where questioning is extremely unwelcome. 

Indeed, nothing is as it seems.
