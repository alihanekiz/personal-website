Have you ever taken a moment to consider just how odd it is that you or I are alive? 

Well, I have and the more I think about it, the odder it seems. 

It’s strange to think that everything we experience thus far in life can be simply described as a stream of leading moments; each one composed of an incalculable number of little pieces of the universe falling into place that can never again come together in exactly the same way. A series of instances that if put together, would tell the story of our lives.

We live in a gigantic soup, where what separates you or me from everything else isn’t entirely clear. It begs the question: If my very composition is impermanent; if cells and microorganisms die and are replaced, if matter changes states; What am I?

With every fleeting moment that passes, entropy is working its destructive magic on us. And just like everyone that came before us, our closing act will eventually come. It may be tomorrow or next month, or 70 years from now. What I do know, is I am aging and an unknown percentage of my life has already been lived. This is simply an admission to reality in the brevity of life. An admission to the rules of the game. The same rules that have always existed; we are born; we live; we die.

And some part of me knows that this is how this works and I don’t have much to say in that matter. 

Still, whether or not I’m nothing more than a meandering passenger witnessing a million predetermined photographs that the universe blend into each other; I can’t help but think that it’s fascinating all the same.

An infinite number of events had to take place to bring us to this very instant and yet here we are. 

I like to imagine how the lives of everyone around me are every bit as rich and intense as mine; their desires as real as any of my own. 

Perhaps they share some of my thoughts or I share some of theirs. 

And so, billions of equally incredibly improbable lives are unfolding in parallel with my own.

Some of us will cross paths and we’ll share some of these fleeting moments together. We’ll laugh and we’ll talk and we’ll miss each other. We’ll hesitate and we’ll love and we’ll cry. We’ll piss each other off. We’ll do silly inexplicable things, and eventually at some point our paths will split again.

These moments, meaningful or meaningless as they may be, feel real.

I am not sure how much the answers to my questions matter really. It doesn’t change the contract. I doesn’t change that life inherently ends.

While some might take that as a crushingly depressing idea, I don’t quite feel the same way. This is just the way things are, and there’s something rather liberating about accepting it. 

All the worry, the drama, the doubt, the stress; all of it so exists, but when I look at things this way, at least I can occasionally step back and get a glimpse of something different. 

The story that’s happening underneath all of our individual stories. For a short period of time I can look at everything with a little more curiosity, a little more perspective, that I’m just a very small piece of a very big puzzle.

It’s all as important or as unimportant as I choose it to be. There’s actually no such thing as winning and losing, no such thing as getting ahead or falling behind. Life in this world is a strange absurd experience and maybe it’s a complete waste of time to even try explaining it.

Perhaps all the pain comes from trying to hold on to any one piece of it while the whole thing moves and changes.

For a reason that still escapes me, I have been given the peculiar opportunity to spend a life that began ending as soon as it began. I’ve been given the peculiar opportunity to live in this time and place.
